## About Me  

👋 Hi, I’m **Jade**!  

🧠 My academic path began with a **major in Psychology**, where I developed a strong foundation in behavioral neuroscience and gravitated toward analytically focused coursework. Along the way, I completed a wide range of computer science courses, but I ultimately discovered that my passion lay in data science.  

👩🏻‍💻 This led me to pursue a **minor in Data Science**, where I gained expertise in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization. I worked on projects analyzing mental health trends and educational outcomes, blending my background in psychology with data-driven insights.  

🎓 Currently, I am pursuing my **Master of Data Science (MDS)** at the University of British Columbia, where I aim to deepen my technical expertise and broaden my ability to apply data science to pressing societal challenges.  

💼 I am seeking opportunities as a **data scientist** in organizations that use data for social good. My goal is to transform complex data into actionable insights that drive positive change in mental health and beyond.
