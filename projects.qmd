## Prediction of Mental Illness Severity Based on Age of First Substance Use
**Link**: [GitHub](https://github.com/DSCI-310-2025/dsci-310-group-7-data-dudes)  
**Duration**: Jan 2025 – Present  
**Tools Used**: R, Predictive Modeling, Data Preprocessing  

In this ongoing project, I am analyzing the relationship between the age of first substance use and the presence or severity of mental illness. Using predictive modeling techniques in R, I am developing a robust analysis pipeline that automates data processing and model evaluation. The project emphasizes *reproducibility*, incorporating version control through GitHub and a containerized computational environment via *Docker*.

## Prediction of Student Performance in Mathematics
**Link**: [GitHub](https://github.com/jadeeechen/stat-301_student-performance-mathematics_winter-2023/blob/main/Project%20-%20Group%20Final%20Report.ipynb)  
**Duration**: Sept 2023 – Dec 2023  
**Tools Used**: R, Lasso Regularization, Predictive Modeling  

In this project, I used **Lasso regularization** to predict student performance in mathematics. By applying **predictive modeling** techniques in R, I was able to improve the model’s accuracy by 7%. The project involved extensive **data preprocessing**, feature selection, and **model evaluation**.

## Wellbeing During COVID-19 in the UK
**Link**: [GitHub](https://github.com/samnthorne/dsci320-FinalProject/tree/main)    
**Duration**: Sept 2023 – Dec 2023  
**Tools Used**: Python, Data Visualization, Pandas, Matplotlib  

This project involved analyzing mental health trends during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. I created **interactive visualizations** to showcase the impact of the pandemic on wellbeing, using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for plotting. The goal was to identify patterns in the data and provide actionable insights.
