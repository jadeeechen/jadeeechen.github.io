    "text": "👋 Hi, I’m Jade!\n👩🏻‍🍳 My journey began in an unexpected place—the kitchen. As a pastry chef, I thrived in fine dining, wholesale, and catering environments, where precision and efficiency were essential. While I loved the craft, I realized that the industry’s lifestyle wasn’t the right long-term fit for me.\n🧠 This led me to explore my interest in human behavior, pursuing a B.A. in Psychology. I developed a strong foundation in behavioral neuroscience, gravitating toward analytically focused coursework. Through my studies, I became increasingly curious about how data could be used to better understand complex social issues.\n👩🏻‍💻 That curiosity led me to pursue a B.Sc. minor in Data Science, where I gained expertise in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization. I worked on projects analyzing mental health trends and educational outcomes, blending my passion for psychology with data-driven insights.\n💼 Now, as I approach graduation in May 2025, I’m looking for opportunities as a data analyst in organizations that use data for social good. My goal is to transform complex data into actionable insights that drive positive change in mental health and beyond."
