Along the way, I completed a wide range of computer science courses, but I ultimately discovered that my passion lay in data science.\n👩🏻‍💻 This led me to pursue a minor in Data Science, where I gained expertise in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization. I worked on projects analyzing mental health trends and educational outcomes, blending my background in psychology with data-driven insights.\n🎓 Currently, I am pursuing my Master of Data Science (MDS) at the University of British Columbia, where I aim to deepen my technical expertise and broaden my ability to apply data science to pressing societal challenges.\n💼 I am seeking opportunities as a data scientist in organizations that use data for social good. My goal is to transform complex data into actionable insights that drive positive change in mental health and beyond."
